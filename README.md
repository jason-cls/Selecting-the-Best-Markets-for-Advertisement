# Selecting the Best Markets for Advertisement
In this project I determine the two best markets to advertise in for a company which offers programming courses focusing on web development and mobile development, as well as other domains. To support the marketing decisions made, freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey was analyzed, with the data publicly available [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).

### Results
- 86% of students have an interest in either mobile or web development
- A large majority of new coders reside in the USA (46%)
- Students in the USA have the largest budget allotted for learning programming online, followed by Canada
- We should market in the USA and Canada since these markets have the highest average monthly expenditure and a large number of students 

### Libraries used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
